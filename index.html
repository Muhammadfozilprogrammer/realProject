              One of the main reasons to hire a car in Dubai is the quality of
              the UAE roads. According to the World Economic Forum, the Emirates
              belong to the top seven countries with the most exemplary road
              infrastructure. All the roads and carriageways are constantly
              maintained and looked after, and their excellent condition is the
              result of a special government program. This is why driving from
              Dubai to far away destinations seems so exciting and thrilling!
              And if you are fond of new experiences and adventure, your Dubai
              holiday will not be complete without visiting a few fascinating
              UAU districts.

              Dubai is a wonderwork with heaps of attractions, but if you are
              thinking about giving your hired car a good run, Abu-Dhabi is a
              place that should be the first on your list. A car trip from Dubai
              to Abu-Dhabi is only around two hours and you will not be sorry
              one mere minute of it! This would be a pleasant and enduring
              journey filled with vivid and bright memories. Once you are there,
              use your time well, so that you can be fulfilled with impressions
              at the end of the day. This beautiful city is not only the capital
              of the wealthiest and largest emirate, it is a sparkling
              architectural gem created on a glorious cluster of islands.
              Abu-Dhabi represents a curious balance of new and old, history and
              modernity, and its fantastic mixture of skyscrapers and green
              boulevards, deluxe shopping malls and epic museums can easily
              compete with what you’ve seen in Dubai. This voyage is a great
              opportunity to experience a new place with its unique atmosphere.
              We are sure that you wouldn’t want to miss a visit to the glowing
              Sheik Zayed Mosque, or to a splendid Louvre Museum, spend a day in
              an expansive Emirate Park Zoo, or have a long evening walk on the
              Corniche that is lined with countless footpaths, parks and
              beaches. It’s impossible to mention everything, so do your best to
              extend your stay in Abu-Dhabi and experience its other famous
              attractions such as an adventurous Ferrari World, the iconic
              Heritage Village, the Observation Deck at 300, Al Jahili Fort, or
              a topped-up with fun and a night-life Yas Island.
